# Engineers For Exploration, UCSD (Summer 2022)
This project was part of a larger research project to track the movement of collared lizards using radio tags. The system uses a set of radio towers around the perimeter of a tracking zone to determine the positions of radio tags to within 2 cm. To maximize range, the antennas must be placed at least 3 m in the air. I was responsible for the phyiscal design of the antenna towers and electronics packaging.

Due to the size of each tracking zone, 10-20 towers are required per area of interest. To reduce setup time and difficulty, I designed the towers to be lightweight and easy to assemble. 

## V1.0
This design uses a 1.25" mast supported by guy wires to stabilize the antenna. Most parts are off-the-shelf to allow for easy repairs and modifications. A custom 3D printed part is used to securely hold the antenna in place.

Note that due to the use of guy wires, this design requires the towers to be fixed to the ground with stakes. After the completion of this design, updated information was received about the tracking zones. The new zones were mostly bedrock, making putting stakes in much more difficult.

## V2.0
This design is made up of PVC tubes and is designed to be attached to trees with ratchet straps. This solves the issue of putting stakes into the ground and greatly reduces the size of the overall package (1.1 m in height).

The final deployment will likely use a mix of both designs, allowing for greater flexibility in tracking zone choice.
